          <p>I can not believe it took so long to get my blog up. Don't get me wrong here the first commit I made, just took me literally 5 mins. But, it was just a mental block, I just kept this task at the very bottom of my backburner. Well, better late than never. </p>
          <p>This blog is going to be about things I care about, and may be some things that fascinate me enough. I am planning to keep it mostly a technical blog, except may be some short stories about my baby. If those are topics of your interest, hope you enjoy reading my posts.</p>
          <p>Alright, getting to the topic at hand.<br>This is a technique I learned while doing <a href="https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow/learn/v4/">a course on udemy</a>, very good course, highly recommend it. What I am doing here is, giving position relative to the container div, which allows me to absolutely position the div containing text content on top of it. Next, I give absolute position to the text context. Now positioning the text in center horizontally is relatively straight forward, width of 100% and text-align will do the trick. To position vertically, we need to do these steps:
          1) Give top and left values for position, Here we are bringing the top of the text div at the center of the image, left is at 0 (remember the width is 100%, so left is 0)
          2) We move the text vertically so that instead of its top being at 50%, its center coincides with the image's center, we are doing that by transform: translateY(-50%); which is basically moving the text div vertically along the negative y-axis 50% relative to the size of the text div. </p>

                &ensp;&ensp; text-align: center;<br>
                &ensp;&ensp; transform: translateY(-50%);<br>
              &ensp; }<br>
